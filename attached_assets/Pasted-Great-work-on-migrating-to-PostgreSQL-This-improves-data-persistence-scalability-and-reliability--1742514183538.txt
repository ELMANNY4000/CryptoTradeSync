Great work on migrating to PostgreSQL! This improves data persistence, scalability, and reliability. Here are some additional features and improvements you might consider:

---

### **1. Performance & Optimization**
âœ… **Indexing & Query Optimization**  
- Ensure frequently accessed tables (orders, transactions, wallets) have proper indexing for **faster queries**.  
- Use **connection pooling** (e.g., PgBouncer) to handle multiple database connections efficiently.  

âœ… **Caching Layer**  
- Implement **Redis** for caching market data, user sessions, and frequently accessed queries.  
- Reduce database load by caching real-time price updates instead of frequent queries.  

âœ… **Background Processing**  
- Offload heavy tasks (trade execution, order matching) using **Celery, Sidekiq, or BullMQ**.

### **2. Security Enhancements**
âœ… **Database Security**  
- Encrypt sensitive data like **API keys, passwords, and private keys** (use **PostgreSQL pgcrypto**).  
- Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** for admin & user privileges.  

âœ… **Transaction Integrity & Fraud Prevention**  
- Add **anti-money laundering (AML) monitoring** for suspicious transaction patterns.  
- Implement **rate limiting** to prevent abuse (too many requests/orders per second).  

âœ… **Audit Logs**  
- Keep detailed logs of all **trades, deposits, withdrawals, and account activities** for security audits.

### **3. Feature Enhancements**
ðŸš€ **Advanced Order Types**  
- Stop-limit, trailing stop, OCO (One Cancels the Other).  

ðŸš€ **Liquidity & Market Making**  
- Integrate with **Binance, Kraken, or B2Broker** for deeper liquidity.  
- Implement **automated market-making (AMM)** strategies.  

ðŸš€ **Portfolio & Analytics Dashboard**  
- Show **real-time P&L, trade history, and portfolio performance**.  
- Add a **profit calculator for active traders**.  

ðŸš€ **API for Developers**  
- Provide an **OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation** for trading bots & third-party integrations.  

ðŸš€ **Mobile App or PWA**  
- Offer a **mobile-friendly version** or build a **React Native / Flutter app**.  

---

### **4. Compliance & Legal Requirements**
âœ… **KYC/AML Improvements**  
- Automate KYC verification (e.g., SumSub, Onfido).  
- Implement **sanctions screening & PEP checks**.  

âœ… **Regulatory Compliance**  
- Ensure compliance with **GDPR, FATF, SEC, FCA, and other financial regulators**.  
- Implement **transaction reporting** for large trades.
